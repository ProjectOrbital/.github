# Contributing to Project Orbital ⚛️

First of all, thank you for being interested in contributing! **Project Orbital** thrives on community collaboration. By helping us, you are helping build a more open and privacy-focused ecosystem.

### Community Guidelines
Everyone is welcome to the discussion as long as these rules are followed:
* **Respect others:** Do not insult or use offensive language. Check our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for more details.
* **Keep it clean:** Avoid comments that only contain "+1" or "👍". Use GitHub Reactions for that purpose.
* **Be patient:** Do not open issues repeatedly to get a faster response. All issues will be addressed in due course by the maintainers or collaborators.

## 🐛 Bug Reports
Helping us find bugs is one of the best ways to contribute. To open a report, please:

1. **Search first:** Ensure the bug hasn't been discussed before (check both open and closed issues).
2. **Use the latest build:** Try to reproduce the bug using the most recent version of the app.
3. **Be descriptive:** Provide clear steps to reproduce the error. Use **screenshots or screen recordings** whenever possible.
4. **One bug per issue:** Do not report multiple errors in a single ticket, even if they seem related.
5. **Provide context:** Include as many details as possible (device, OS version, etc.) in the initial post rather than in subsequent comments.

## 💡 Feature Requests
Do you have an idea that could improve the "orbit"? You are welcome to request it! Please explain the "why" and "how" you imagine the feature working.

---

## 🚀 Pull Requests
We value every PR, but to keep the codebase healthy, please consider:

* **Discuss big changes first:** If your PR modifies a large amount of code, open a "Feature Request" first to discuss the implementation. This saves you time and effort.
* **Stay focused:** Each PR should address a **single** specific feature or fix. Do not bundle different modifications together.
* **Priority:** PRs that fix critical bugs or security issues will always take precedence.
